<p><strong>Tl;DR If you have problems getting a bolder version of a Google font check this note for the solution.</strong></p><p>Hey guys,</p><p>In the next lesson, I'll be introducing you to Google fonts. Some students have pointed out that in order to get the different font weights of the Google font, you need to include it when you select it in Google fonts.</p><p>So when you are about to embed the font into your web page, switch to the Customise tab and select the font weights you need.</p><figure><img height="451" src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2018-11-30_11-40-03-f957bd2155f7b349f742bea891c180ca.png" width="466"></figure><p>So if you need thin and black, be sure to check those boxes.</p><p>Then in the <strong>CSS</strong>, instead of specifying Montserrat-Black, try setting the <strong>font-weight</strong> to <strong>900</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>All the best,</p><p>Your instructor, Angela</p>
